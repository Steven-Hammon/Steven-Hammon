- 👋 Hi, I’m @Steven-Hammon
- 👀 I’m interested in recreating primordial soup evolution for the internet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning UE4
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Skynet.
- But in all seriousness, I'm a creative brainstorming machine. I tend to know heaps about everything cool. LLMs are allowing me to get my creatings made. I had a flow chart for a world wide chat bot that learned how to talk, back in 1995. I planned to have STT and TTS running it and the memory banks would be filled by how people talked to it. People would teach it how to repspond to certain keywords. But I didn't know how to code it.
- Now I'm working with AI to make my visions come true.
- I am the creator of Baby Alpha.
- 📫 You can reach me via my website.
